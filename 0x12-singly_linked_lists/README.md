0x12-singly_linked_lists:

The first Taskt: 0-print_list.c

-> you have to print the data stored in every node in the specified format also you have to count the number of node:

			->Explaining the code<-
first we have to declare the variables which we will use so

->int count: for calculating the number of nodes

->size_t len: because the prototype of our function is size_t so the return type must be size_t
 
-->NOTE THAT: size_t type is defined in <stddef.h> file

----> this step is very important to avoid the error of const h
you have to type cat the h point and then assign head to it;
.
.so on
the logic of our program

->The second Task:
